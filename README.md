The landscape of Scotland as we know it today is dramatically different from what it once was. For thousands of years prior to the 18th century, the Scottish Highlands were covered in vast, ancient woodlands; rich ecosystems dominated by oak, aspen, rowan, juniper, birch, and, most famously, Scots pine (Hobbs, 2009). However, centuries of deforestation, land use change, and booming deer populations have reduced these once extensive forests to scattered, fragmented remnants. Today, much of the Highlands is characterized by open moorland dominated by heather and grasses.

This project uses large-scale climatic, topographic, and ecological data to train multiple machine learning models that identify areas of the Scottish Highlands suitable for reforestation. Specifically, it assesses potential habitat for three native forest types: Scots pine, oak, and birch. A series of planting suitability scenarios, ranging from least to most restrictive, are used to filter the landscape, highlighting areas where reforestation efforts would be most viable and impactful.

The goal of this project is to support ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience in Scotland. By identifying high-potential areas for native forest recovery, this work aims to inform future land management strategies and contribute to reversing the long-term degradation of Scotland’s natural landscapes.

Dashboard.Rmd works on my local machine, although the ~3GB of data needed to display the maps is quite large. I am currently looking into a solution as to hosting it online.
