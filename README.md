# Scotland-Reforestation
The landscape of Scotland that we are all familar with today is a stark contrast to the landscape that was present for the millenia preceeding the 18th century (Hobbs, 2009). Prior to the 18th century the Scottish Highlands was home to large swathes of forest including oaks, aspens, rowans, junipers, birch and most iconically of all, the Scots pine. Now, after centuries of deforestation and a boom in deer populations, the extensive forests of the Highlands have been switched out for abundant heather and grass species, with the Caledonian pine forest now only exisitng in fragmented, remnant patches.

Using large scale climate, topographical and ecological data, I train multiple machine learning algorithms to assess sites in the Scottish Highlands that are suitable for the reforestation of three different forest cover types: Scots pine, oak or birch. The scenarios that were used help to filter out the sites on the landscape based upon a gradient of general tree planting suitability.
