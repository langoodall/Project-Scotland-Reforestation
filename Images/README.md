Reforestation-Potential.png depicts a map that shows the probability that a cell would be predicted as one of the three forest cover types for reforestation. Scenarios descend in how restrictive the planting regime will be and the models represent the different algorithms used for prediction. Scenarios were created from the Soil Survey of Scotland (1988)
